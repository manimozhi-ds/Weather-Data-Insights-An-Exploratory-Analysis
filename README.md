# 🌦️ Weather Data Insights: An Exploratory Analysis

> A hands-on exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on historical weather data using Python. This notebook explores 10 years of hourly meteorological observations to uncover patterns in temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and more.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze a large real-world weather dataset using EDA techniques. By cleaning, transforming, and visualizing the data, we uncover key patterns and relationships between meteorological variables over time.

This project demonstrates:
- Practical use of pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn
- Correlation analysis and feature engineering
- Understanding daily and seasonal trends
- Data storytelling with visualizations
